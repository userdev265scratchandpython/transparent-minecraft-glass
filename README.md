This is a texture pack designed to remove all glass textures, allowing you to create a glass maze, for example. Feel free to modify it and redistribute it, but remember to edit the "pack.metadata" file beforehand.
It is recomended to use it on 1.21.1 as it was tested there.
It allows to make invisible bases in survival, but if someone doesn't have the pack, they aren't fooled.
